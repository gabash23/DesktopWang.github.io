            <h2>Project Info:</h2>
            <p>Hello there! We are a team of three from Bergen County Academies, and this is our final project, Desktop Wang. 
                We were inspired by the fear of our beloved computer science teacher (Mr.Wang) leaving our school, as well as the beauty of the app Desktop Goose.
                We built it to test our knowledge of JavaFX, and now the final product is avaliable to you for free! Just press the download button above to download!</p>
            <h2>Project Description:</h2>
            <p>A walking, talking, and almost breathing Mr. Wang living on your desktop! He will randomly move around and pull up images, videos, and even play sound recordings from the main man himself.
                We have also taken the liberty of adding additional features and easter eggs 😉
